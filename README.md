## Description
This repository contains an application that uses a database to store, update, and retrieve data to generate viewable tables containing quantitative information about employees roles and departments within a sample imaginary company for reference.


## Development
To begin a database was created using mysql workbench to generate three tables for employees, roles, and departments that were then seeded, and linked through the assignment of foreighn keys with cascading. Next a crude javascript file that connected to the database was created along with functions for adding updating and deleting fields. Lastly inquiry prompts were created with the previous nested functions inside of them, and initialization function was used to start the application.
